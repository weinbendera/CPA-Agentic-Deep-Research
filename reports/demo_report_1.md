### 1. Family Employment Tax Strategy: Evaluate the tax benefits of employing family members in the business to shift income to lower tax brackets.

#### Overview
This section evaluates the tax benefits of employing family members in a business to shift income to lower tax brackets. The strategy involves employing family members, such as children, to take advantage of lower tax rates and potential exemptions from certain payroll taxes. This can be particularly beneficial in S-corporations where income can be distributed as wages to family members, reducing the overall tax liability.

#### Client's Situation
The client, operating as an S-corporation, has a total income of $286,036 for 2023. They have two dependents, Grayson and Reed, who could potentially be employed in the business. The client's current tax strategy does not include employing family members, which could be a missed opportunity for tax savings.

#### Research Findings
1. **Employing Family Members**: Employing children in a family business can reduce the overall tax liability. For example, wages paid to a child under 18 are not subject to FICA or FUTA taxes if the business is a sole proprietorship or a partnership where each partner is a parent of the child. [Employing Family Members - North Georgia Accounting LLC](https://ngas.us/uploads/1/4/0/6/140645858/employing_family_members.pdf)

2. **IRS Guidelines**: The IRS provides specific guidelines for family employees. Payments to children under 18 are exempt from FICA taxes if the business is a sole proprietorship or a partnership of parents. However, if the business is a corporation, these exemptions do not apply. [Family Employees | Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/family-employees)

3. **2024 IRS Guidelines for S-Corporations**: For S-corporations, if a shareholder or a family member renders services without reasonable compensation, the IRS may adjust the items taken into account to reflect the value of such services. [2024 Instructions for Form 1120-S](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1120s.pdf)

#### Recommendations
- **Consider Employing Dependents**: The client should consider employing their dependents, Grayson and Reed, in the business. This could shift income to lower tax brackets and potentially exempt some wages from payroll taxes.
- **Review Business Structure**: Since the business is an S-corporation, the client should review the structure to ensure compliance with IRS guidelines regarding family employment.
- **Document Employment**: Ensure proper documentation of employment, including job descriptions and hours worked, to substantiate the business purpose and avoid IRS scrutiny.

#### Savings Opportunities
- **Tax Bracket Shifting**: By employing family members, the client can shift income to lower tax brackets, potentially saving thousands in taxes.
- **Payroll Tax Exemptions**: If structured correctly, wages paid to children under 18 may be exempt from FICA and FUTA taxes, providing additional savings.

#### Additional Documents To Look Into
- **Payroll Records**: To further analyze the potential savings, reviewing payroll records and employment contracts for family members would be beneficial.
- **S-Corporation Bylaws**: Reviewing the S-corporation bylaws can ensure compliance with IRS regulations regarding family employment.

### 2. Section 179 vs. Bonus Depreciation Analysis: Determine whether Section 179 expensing or bonus depreciation provides the optimal tax benefit for equipment purchases.

#### Overview
This section evaluates the tax benefits of Section 179 expensing versus bonus depreciation for equipment purchases, aiming to maximize tax savings for the client. The analysis incorporates the latest tax benefits and limitations for 2024, providing strategic insights for optimal tax planning.

#### Client's Situation
The client, filing jointly, has a business income loss from Oxazon LLC and Metavasi Fund LP, with a total adjusted gross income of $280,686. The client is considering equipment purchases and needs to determine the best tax strategy to maximize deductions.

#### Research Findings
- **Section 179 Expensing**: Allows a taxpayer to expense up to $1.22 million of the total cost of new and used qualified assets placed in service in 2024. The deduction is limited by the amount by which the cost of Section 179 property exceeds $3,050,000. [Source: Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/section-179-expensing/)
- **Bonus Depreciation**: Allows businesses to deduct a larger portion of certain investments in the first year. It applies to new or improved technology, equipment, or buildings, incentivizing investment by alleviating tax code bias. [Source: Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/section-179-expensing/)
- **IRS Publication 946**: Confirms the Section 179 deduction limits and provides examples of how the deduction can be applied. [Source: IRS Publication 946](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946)

#### Analysis
The client's document does not indicate any inconsistencies regarding the use of Section 179 or bonus depreciation. The choice between Section 179 and bonus depreciation should be based on the client's current and projected taxable income, as well as the nature and cost of the equipment.

#### Recommendations
1. **Evaluate Equipment Costs**: Determine the total cost of equipment purchases to assess eligibility for Section 179 expensing.
2. **Consider Future Income**: If the client anticipates higher income in future years, bonus depreciation may be more beneficial as it allows for larger deductions upfront.
3. **Review Asset Classes**: Ensure the equipment qualifies under Section 179 or bonus depreciation rules.
4. **Tax Planning**: Coordinate with the client's overall tax strategy, considering other deductions and credits available.

#### Savings Opportunities
- **Section 179**: If the equipment cost is within the limits, Section 179 can provide immediate tax savings by expensing the full cost.
- **Bonus Depreciation**: Offers significant upfront deductions, which can be advantageous if the client expects to be in a higher tax bracket in future years.

#### Additional Documents To Look Into
- **Detailed Equipment Purchase Records**: To verify eligibility and optimize the deduction strategy.
- **Projected Income Statements**: To align the depreciation strategy with future income expectations.

### 3. Home Office Deduction for Pass-Through Entities: Analyze whether taking the home office deduction at the business level or personal level provides greater tax benefit.

#### Overview
This report evaluates the tax implications of claiming the home office deduction at the business versus personal level for pass-through entities, with a focus on S-corporations. The analysis aims to identify the most beneficial approach for the client's current tax situation, considering their business income loss.

#### Client's Situation
The clients have reported various income sources, including wages, dividends, and rental income. They are experiencing a business income loss from Oxazon LLC, a pass-through entity, and are filing jointly. Their tax strategy focuses on maximizing deductions and credits to minimize tax liability.

#### Research Findings
1. **Business Income Deduction**: Pass-through entities can benefit from the Section 199A deduction, allowing a 20% deduction on qualified business income. This is advantageous when business income is substantial. [Section 199A Pass-Through Deduction](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/reforming-pass-through-deduction-199a/)

2. **Pass-Through Business Alternative Income Tax (PTE/BAIT)**: States like New Jersey offer pass-through entities the option to pay taxes at the entity level, providing a credit to members, which can be beneficial in high-tax states. [Pass-Through Business Alternative Income Tax (PTE/BAIT)](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/baitpte/index.shtml)

3. **Home Office Deduction**: For S-corporations, the deduction can be taken at the corporate level, reducing taxable income, or reimbursed to the employee-shareholder, which may be more beneficial if the corporation is not profitable. [Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p587)

#### Analysis
- **Business Level Deduction**: Reduces the S-corporation's taxable income, beneficial if the corporation is profitable. Given the loss from Oxazon LLC, this may not be optimal.
- **Personal Level Deduction**: Reimbursing home office expenses to the employee-shareholder can reduce personal taxable income, potentially lowering overall tax liability.

#### Recommendations
- **Reimbursement Strategy**: Reimburse home office expenses to the employee-shareholder to reduce personal taxable income, especially given the business loss.
- **Review State Tax Options**: Explore state-specific tax strategies, such as PTE/BAIT, to maximize tax credits and deductions.

#### Savings Opportunities
- **Maximize Section 199A Deduction**: Ensure full utilization of the Section 199A deduction to significantly reduce taxable income.
- **Optimize Home Office Deduction**: Reimbursing home office expenses can lower personal tax liability, particularly in light of the business loss from Oxazon LLC.

#### Additional Documents To Look Into
- **Detailed Home Office Expense Records**: Obtaining detailed records of home office expenses would allow for precise calculation of the deduction at both the business and personal levels, enhancing the analysis.

### 4. Qualified Business Income Deduction Eligibility: Determine eligibility for the 20% QBI deduction under Section 199A for pass-through business income.

#### Overview
This section evaluates the eligibility for the 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction under Section 199A for pass-through business income. The QBI deduction allows eligible taxpayers to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income, subject to certain limitations and thresholds.

#### Client's Situation
- The client, filing jointly, has a taxable income of $236,679 before the QBI deduction.
- The client's business, Oxazon LLC, reported a qualified business loss of $11,209.
- The client has a QBI deduction of $89 reported on Form 8995.

#### Research Findings
- For 2024, the taxable income threshold for married filing jointly is $383,900. If the taxable income is below this threshold, the business is treated as a qualified trade or business, potentially allowing for the QBI deduction.
- The de minimis rule states that if gross receipts are more than $25 million and less than 5% are from services, the business is not considered a specified service trade or business (SSTB), allowing for QBI deduction eligibility.
- [2024 Instructions for Form 8995-A](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8995a.pdf)

#### Assessment
The client's document appears accurate regarding the QBI deduction. The taxable income is below the threshold, and the QBI deduction of $89 is correctly calculated based on the qualified business loss and REIT dividends.

#### Recommendations
- **Review Business Income:** Ensure that all business income and expenses are accurately reported to maximize the QBI deduction.
- **Monitor Income Levels:** Keep taxable income below the threshold to maintain eligibility for the full QBI deduction.
- **Consider REIT Investments:** Explore additional qualified REIT dividends to potentially increase the QBI deduction.

#### Additional Documents To Look Into
- **Detailed Business Financials:** To verify the accuracy of reported business income and expenses, which could impact the QBI deduction.
- **REIT Dividend Statements:** To ensure all qualified REIT dividends are accounted for in the QBI calculation.

### 5. S-Corporation Reasonable Compensation Analysis: Evaluate if the salary taken by S-corp owners is reasonable based on industry standards to optimize self-employment tax savings.

#### Overview
This report evaluates the reasonable compensation for S-Corporation owners, focusing on compliance with IRS guidelines and optimizing self-employment tax savings. The analysis is based on industry standards and the client's specific financial documents.

#### Client's Situation
- The client is involved in an S-Corporation, Oxazon LLC, with a reported ordinary loss of $11,209 for 2023.
- Total adjusted gross income is $280,686, including wages, interest, dividends, and rental income.
- No self-employment tax is reported, indicating that the S-Corporation may not have paid a salary to the shareholder-employee.

#### Research Findings
- **Reasonable Compensation Requirement**: S-Corporations must pay reasonable compensation to shareholder-employees for services provided before making non-wage distributions. [IRS Guidance on S-Corporation Compensation](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporation-compensation-and-medical-insurance-issues)
- **Industry Standards**: Compensation should align with industry standards, considering factors like duties, responsibilities, and time devoted to the business. [2024 Instructions for Form 100S S Corporation Tax Booklet](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2024/2024-100s-booklet.html)

#### Analysis
- **Compliance Risk**: The absence of a reported salary for the S-Corporation owner may pose a compliance risk with IRS guidelines, as reasonable compensation is required.
- **Tax-Saving Opportunity**: By paying a reasonable salary, the client can optimize self-employment tax savings and ensure compliance.

#### Recommendations
1. **Determine Reasonable Salary**: Evaluate industry standards and the owner's role to determine a reasonable salary. Consider using salary surveys or industry reports.
2. **Adjust Payroll**: Implement a payroll system to ensure regular salary payments to the shareholder-employee.
3. **Document Compensation**: Maintain documentation supporting the salary determination to defend against potential IRS scrutiny.

#### Savings
- **Self-Employment Tax Optimization**: By paying a reasonable salary, the client can reduce the risk of IRS penalties and optimize self-employment tax savings.
- **Compliance Assurance**: Ensures compliance with IRS guidelines, reducing the risk of audits and associated costs.

#### Additional Documents To Look Into
- **Industry Salary Surveys**: To accurately determine the reasonable compensation for the S-Corporation owner, industry-specific salary surveys or reports would be beneficial. These documents will provide benchmarks for compensation based on similar roles and responsibilities.

### 6. Net Investment Income Tax Mitigation: Identify strategies to reduce exposure to the 3.8% NIIT, focusing on investment income and modified adjusted gross income thresholds.

#### Overview
This section addresses strategies to mitigate exposure to the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) by focusing on investment income and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) thresholds. The client's current tax documents have been reviewed to identify potential tax-saving opportunities and ensure compliance with NIIT regulations.

#### Client's Situation
- **Filing Status:** Married Filing Jointly
- **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI):** $280,686

- **Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT):** $1,060
- **Investment Income Sources:** Interest, dividends, capital gains, and income from partnerships and S-corporations.
- **Health Savings Account (HSA) Contribution:** $5,350

#### Research Findings
1. **Net Operating Loss (NOL) Application:** In 2024, taxpayers can reduce net investment income by applying NOLs from previous years. [2024 Instructions for Form 8960](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8960.pdf)
2. **Regrouping Activities:** Taxpayers subject to NIIT for the first time may regroup activities to optimize tax outcomes. [Publication 925 (2024)](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p925)
3. **Investment Expenses:** Deductible investment expenses can reduce NIIT liability if not used to offset self-employment income. [2024 Instructions for Form 8960](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8960.pdf)

#### Recommendations
- **Utilize NOLs:** Ensure that any available NOLs are applied to reduce net investment income, thereby lowering NIIT liability.
- **Review Investment Expenses:** Verify that all eligible investment expenses are deducted to minimize net investment income.
- **Consider Regrouping Activities:** If applicable, regroup activities to potentially reduce exposure to NIIT.
- **Maximize HSA Contributions:** Continue maximizing HSA contributions as they provide a deduction that reduces AGI, potentially lowering exposure to NIIT.

#### Savings Opportunities
- **NOL Application:** Applying NOLs can directly reduce net investment income, leading to a decrease in NIIT.
- **Investment Expense Deductions:** Properly deducting investment expenses can lower the taxable net investment income.
- **HSA Contributions:** Maximizing HSA contributions can reduce AGI, which may help in staying below the NIIT threshold.

#### Additional Documents To Look Into
- **Detailed Investment Portfolio:** A detailed breakdown of the client's investment portfolio would help in identifying specific areas where investment expenses can be optimized.
- **Prior Year Tax Returns:** Reviewing prior year tax returns can ensure that all NOLs and other carryforwards are correctly applied.

### 7. Passive Activity Loss Utilization: Analyze passive activity losses and determine strategies to effectively utilize or carry forward these losses.

#### Overview
This report analyzes the utilization of passive activity losses (PALs) for the client, focusing on strategies to effectively utilize or carry forward these losses. The client's tax documents indicate involvement in passive activities through partnerships, with specific losses reported. The report will integrate research findings and provide recommendations for optimizing tax outcomes.

#### Client's Situation
- The client has reported passive activity losses from partnerships, specifically from Oxazon LLC and Metavasi Fund LP.
- Oxazon LLC shows an ordinary loss of $11,209.
- Metavasi Fund LP shows a long-term capital loss of $11,750 and a short-term capital gain of $1,596.
- The client has a total qualified business loss carryforward (QBI) of $11,209.
- The client is filing jointly and has a balance due of $700 on their federal return.

#### Research Findings
- According to [Publication 925 (2024)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p925.pdf), passive activity losses that are not allowed in the current year can be carried forward to future years until they can be offset against passive income.
- Disposition of the entire interest in a passive activity allows for the full deduction of suspended losses in the year of disposition, provided the transaction is recognized and the acquirer is not related.
- A special $25,000 allowance may apply for rental real estate activities if the taxpayer actively participates and meets income requirements.

#### Recommendations
1. **Disposition Strategy**: Consider disposing of the entire interest in Oxazon LLC or Metavasi Fund LP if feasible, to fully utilize suspended losses. Ensure the transaction is recognized and the acquirer is unrelated.
2. **Active Participation**: If applicable, ensure active participation in rental real estate activities to qualify for the special $25,000 allowance.
3. **Carryforward Management**: Continue to track and manage the carryforward of passive losses to offset future passive income.
4. **S-Corp Analysis**: Review any S-Corp involvement for potential passive income that could offset these losses.

#### Savings Opportunities
- By disposing of the entire interest in a passive activity, the client can potentially utilize $11,209 in suspended losses from Oxazon LLC, reducing taxable income.
- Active participation in rental activities could allow for an additional $25,000 deduction, subject to income limitations.

#### Additional Documents To Look Into
- **S-Corp K-1s**: To assess any passive income that could offset the reported losses.
- **Detailed Partnership Agreements**: To evaluate the feasibility and implications of disposing of partnership interests.

#### Research Findings
- **Child Tax Credit (CTC)**: For 2024, the CTC is up to $2,000 per qualifying child. The client has claimed $4,000 for two children, which aligns with the maximum allowable credit.
- **Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC)**: Up to $1,700 per child may be refundable. The client's return does not show a refundable ACTC, which is consistent with their income level and tax liability.
- **Sources**:
  - [Refundable tax credits | Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/refundable-tax-credits)
  - [Minnesota's Child Credit and Working Family Credit](https://www.house.mn.gov/hrd/pubs/ss/sschldwfc.pdf)

#### Assessment
The client's tax return accurately reflects the Child Tax Credit and does not show any inconsistencies. The AGI is within the phase-out range, and the credit claimed is correct based on the number of qualifying children.

#### Recommendations
- **Monitor Income Levels**: Ensure that the AGI remains within the allowable range to maximize the CTC and ACTC in future years.
- **Review Tax Planning Strategies**: Consider tax planning strategies to manage AGI, such as retirement contributions or other deductions, to optimize credit eligibility.

#### Additional Documents To Look Into
- **Form 8812**: Review for any potential changes in the ACTC eligibility or calculations that may affect future tax years.

#### Savings
- **Maximization of Credits**: The client has effectively maximized the CTC for 2023. Continued monitoring and strategic planning can help maintain this benefit.
- **Potential ACTC**: If income levels change, the client may become eligible for the refundable portion of the ACTC, providing additional tax savings.

  - [7 Tax-Smart Strategies to Enhance Your Charitable Gifting Plans](https://www.lutz.us/blog/tax-smart-strategies-enhance-your-charitable-gifting-plans)
  - [Basics of Charitable Giving & Tax Planning Strategies](https://www.forvismazars.us/forsights/2023/12/basics-of-charitable-giving-tax-planning-strategies)

#### Analysis
The client's current itemized deductions already exceed the standard deduction, indicating that they are benefiting from itemizing. However, the charitable contributions are a significant part of their itemized deductions. By employing a bunching strategy, the client could potentially increase their tax savings in future years by alternating between itemizing and taking the standard deduction.

#### Recommendations
1. **Implement Bunching Strategy**: Consider bunching charitable contributions in alternate years to maximize itemized deductions in those years and take the standard deduction in others.
2. **Review Future Contributions**: Plan future charitable contributions to align with years where other itemized deductions are lower, ensuring the total exceeds the standard deduction.
3. **Monitor Tax Law Changes**: Stay updated on any changes to the standard deduction or itemized deduction limits that could impact the effectiveness of the bunching strategy.

#### Savings Opportunities
- **Tax Savings**: By strategically planning charitable contributions, the client can optimize their tax deductions, potentially increasing their tax refund or reducing their tax liability.
- **Document Review**: Ensure all charitable contributions are properly documented to support itemized deductions.

#### Additional Documents To Look Into
- **Charitable Contribution Receipts**: To verify the amounts and ensure compliance with IRS requirements for itemized deductions.
- **Future Income Projections**: To better plan the timing of charitable contributions and other deductions.
